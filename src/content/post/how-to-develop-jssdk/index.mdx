# Definition and Classification of SDK

## What is SDK

SDK is `Software Development Kit`, JSSDK which is a collection of exposed functions to developers to help the front-end realize specific needs.
JS-API Developers can use it to intergrate and use certain specific functions in web pages, such as social sharing, map services, payment functions, etc. It usually includes the followinf modules:

1. Javascript Library: This is SDk the core part of the app, which contains a series of pre-written Javascript codes that impelement some specific functions,
series as user authentication, data analysis, social sharing, etc.

2. API Documentation: This part of the documentation describles in detail how to use JSSDK each feature in the package.
It usually contains a list of functions and methods, and how to use them.

3. Sample code: This part of the code shows how to use it in a real project JSSDK. By reading and running the sample code,
developers can better understand how to use it JSSDK.

## Classification of JSSDK

JSSDK The classification of SDKs mainly depends on the functions and services they provide.
Usually, they are divided into: `UI component library`, `JS tool libray`, `analysis and statistics SDK`, `social media SDK according to their functions`.

**UI Component**: By encapsulating a series of components and helping developers call them through configuration, some UI effects can be achieved, such as: `Antd`, `ElementUI`, `Vant`, etc.

**JS tool library**: By implementing a class of commonly used methods, it is easy to develop and process data without having to consider compatibility.
Commonly used methods includes: `lodash`, `moment`, etc.

**Analysis and statistics SDK**: Through the API, monitor the front-end system's error reporting,
statistical data, and data reporting, such asL `Sentry`, `Google Analytics`, etc.

**Social media SDK**: WeChat SDK, Facebook SDK etc.

# How to design JSSDK

## Principles to follow when designing SDK

![](/princple-follow-to-design-sdk.png)

**Single responsibility princple**: SDk is generally designed to meet the needs of a certain type business, so the business scope must be clearly defined at the beginning of the design.
If the functions are too comples, they can be split into several independent SKDs, and the relevant logic can be introduced into the main SDK,
which facilitates functional decouping and testing.

**The principle of least available and least dependency**: If you can use a certain method to impelement it,
don't make it complicated. The SDK should reduce depenencies, and some tool libraries should be used if possible.
Try to impelement necessary methods by yourself, or introduce as few libraries as possible.
Otherwise, the SDK will be too large after packaging, or there will be compatibility issues by updated versions.

**Stability principle**: Maintain sufficent stability if the SDK. On the one hand keep the API method stable. On the other hand,
when designing the API input paramesters, use object types for parameters,
so that it is easy to add more paramesters in the future.
If the SDK us upgraded, concept compatibility with the old version. New functions should add new APIs, and old APIs should not be deleted.

**Ease of use princple**: To meet the principle of ease of use, we must first have a concise API.
Clear method comments, documentation and sample code are very important.
No matter how beatifully the SDK is written, the first thing users come into contact with is the access documentation, and then the sample code covering all APIs.
A good example code can achieve twice the result with haft the effort.

## Language and build tool selection

### `ts` vs `js`:

- Type system
- Better tool support

### Rollup vs Webpack:


## Implementation OF SDK core functions

### Project structure

`src`: source code

- api/index.ts: API encapsulation for network requests
- core/index.ts: Core entry file
- core/dependencies.ts: Core logic implementation file
- style/index.css: Style file
- types/index.ts: Declared type file
- utils/constants.ts: Constants file
- utils/http.ts: Network request encapsulation library
- utils/indexts: utility functions
- utils/pv.ts: Routing monitoring processing function

### API design

![](/api-design.png)

SDK API The design are divided into two categories according to their functions `life cycle methods` `instance method`

- Lifecycle methods: manily the SDK's lifecycle callback functions: from the init initialization method to the questionnaire openning and closing callbacks.
- Instance method: responsible for specific business implementation


`Note: It should be noted that when designing external APIs, each API must have callback after the method is executed to facilitate users to excute subsequent logic.`
