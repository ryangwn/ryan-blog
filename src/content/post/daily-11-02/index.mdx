`src` usually specifies external resources that need to be embedded in my document, such as pictures and videos, which need to be downloaded.
When the browser parses the src attribute, it will pause the parsing and will not continue until the current resource is downloaded and parsed.
`href` is a hypertext reference, like some a tags used in links.
It establishes an association between the document and external resources.
One is embedded and the other is associated. When I use the a tag, it just jumps and points to a resource address, So it will not affect the parsing of the page.
